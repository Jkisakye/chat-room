# chat-room

This is a terminal based chat app project based on TCP socket programming in python. Users are registered and authenticated before accessing the chat sessions.

There are 2 versions, one is to test different security vulnerabilities and another is to patch them up.


### NOTE:
1. Read through the database.py script before setting up your database

2. Before running the client.py script, fill in the appropriate host name as guided in the comments on line 12(v2-insecure) and line 13(v1-secure)

3. I used python 3.7; lower versions might not have some libraries that i used installed.

4. The library termcolor used in client.py of both versions works best with linux. Some expected effects  won't be seen on windows.
